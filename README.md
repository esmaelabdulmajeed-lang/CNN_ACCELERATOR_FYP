# CNN_ACCELERATOR_FYP
This repository contains the work for our Final Year Project: **Low-level Implementation of a CNN Accelerator**.  
The goal is to design, simulate, and optimize a CNN accelerator starting from MATLAB prototyping to RTL implementation.

## Repository Structure
- `/docs` → Proposals, reports, presentations
- `/matlab` → MATLAB scripts for prototyping CNN layers
- `/rtl` → RTL design in Verilog/SystemVerilog
- `/testbenches` → Verification files
- `/results` → Simulation outputs, images, and logs

## Project Goals
1. Prototype CNN layers (conv, relu, pooling, fc) in MATLAB.
2. Extend prototype with more filters and larger inputs.
3. Translate prototype into RTL blocks (conv + relu + pool).
4. Optimize memory usage and MAC operations in hardware.
